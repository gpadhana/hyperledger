Channels and policies
=====================

Blockchain networks are all about connection, so once you've deployed nodes, you'll obviously want to connect them to other nodes! If you have a peer organization and a peer, you'll want to join your organization to a consortium and join or :doc:`create_channel/create_channel_participation`. If you have an ordering node, you will want to add peer organizations to your consortium. You'll also want to learn how to develop chaincode, which you can learn about in the topics :doc:`developapps/scenario` and :doc:`chaincode4ade`.

Part of the process of connecting nodes and creating channels will involve modifying policies to fit the use cases of business networks. For more information about policies, check out :doc:`policies/policies`.

One of the common tasks in a Fabric will be the editing of existing channels. For a tutorial about that process, check out :doc:`config_update`. One popular channel update is to add an org to an existing channel. For a tutorial about that specific process, check out :doc:`channel_update_tutorial`. For information about upgrading nodes after they have been deployed, check out :doc:`upgrading_your_components`.
