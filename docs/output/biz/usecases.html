<h2>B2B Contract<a class="headerlink" href="#b2b-contract" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Business contracts can be codified to allow two or more parties to
automate contractual agreements in a trusted way. Although information
on blockchain is naturally “public”, B2B contracts may require privacy
control to protect sensitive business information from being disclosed
to outside parties that also have access to the ledger.</p>
<p>While confidential agreements are a key business case, there are many
scenarios where contracts can and should be easily discoverable by all
parties on a ledger. For example, a ledger used to create offers (asks)
seeking bids, by definition, requires access without restriction. This
type of contract may need to be standardized so that bidders can easily
find them, effectively creating an electronic trading platform with
smart contracts (aka chaincode).</p>

integrity of the contract.</li>

<div class="section" id="key-components">
<h3>Key Components<a class="headerlink" href="#key-components" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Multi-sig contract activation - When a contract is first deployed by
one of the counter parties, it will be in the pending activation
state. To activate a contract, signatures from other counterparties
and/or third party participants are required.</li>
<li>Multi-sig contract execution - Some contracts will require one of
many signatures to execute. For example, in trade finance, a payment
instruction can only be executed if either the recipient or an
authorized third party (e.g. UPS) confirms the shipment of the good.</li>
<li>Discoverability - If a contract is a business offer seeking bids, it
must be easily searchable. In addition, such contracts must have the
built-in intelligence to evaluate, select and honor bids.</li>
<li>Atomicity of contract execution - Atomicity of the contract is needed
to guarantee that asset transfers can only occur when payment is
received (Delivery vs. Payment). If any step in the execution process
fails, the entire transaction must be rolled back.</li>
<li>Contract to chain-code communication - Contracts must be able to
communicate with chaincodes that are deployed on the same ledger.</li>
<li>Longer Duration contract - Timer is required to support B2B contracts
that have long execution windows.</li>
<li>Reuseable contracts - Often-used contracts can be standardized for
reuse.</li>
<li>Auditable contractual agreement - Any contract can be made auditable
to third parties.</li>
<li>Contract life-cycle management - B2B contracts are unique and cannot
always be standardized. An efficient contract management system is
needed to enhance the scalability of the ledger network.</li>
<li>Validation access – Only nodes with validation rights are allowed to
validate transactions of a B2B contract.</li>
<li>View access – B2B contracts may include confidential information, so
only accounts with predefined access rights are allowed to view and
interrogate them.</li>

<h2>Manufacturing Supply Chain<a class="headerlink" href="#manufacturing-supply-chain" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Final assemblers, such as automobile manufacturers, can create a supply
chain network managed by its peers and suppliers so that a final
assembler can better manage its suppliers and be more responsive to
events that would require vehicle recalls (possibly triggered by faulty
parts provided by a supplier). The blockchain fabric must provide a
standard protocol to allow every participant on a supply chain network
to input and track numbered parts that are produced and used on a
specific vehicle.</p>
<p>Why is this specific example an abstract use case? Because while all
blockchain cases store immutable information, and some add the need for
transfer of assets between parties, this case emphasizes the need to
provide deep searchability backwards through as many as 5-10 transaction
layers. This backwards search capability is the core of establishing
provenance of any manufactured good that is made up of other component
goods and supplies.</p>

<h3>Key Components<a class="headerlink" href="#id2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Payment upon delivery of goods - Integration with off-chain payment
systems is required, so that payment instructions can be sent when
parts are received.</li>
<li>Third party Audit - All supplied parts must be auditable by third
parties. For example, regulators might need to track the total number
of parts supplied by a specific supplier, for tax accounting
purposes.</li>
<li>Obfuscation of shipments - Balances must be obfuscated so that no
supplier can deduce the business activities of any other supplier.</li>
<li>Obfuscation of market size - Total balances must be obfuscated so
that part suppliers cannot deduce their own market share to use as
leverage when negotiating contractual terms.</li>
<li>Validation Access – Only nodes with validation rights are allowed to

<h2>Asset Depository<a class="headerlink" href="#asset-depository" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Assets such as financial securities must be able to be dematerialized on
a blockchain network so that all stakeholders of an asset type will have
direct access to that asset, allowing them to initiate trades and
acquire information on an asset without going through layers of
intermediaries. Trades should be settled in near real time and all
stakeholders must be able to access asset information in near real time.
A stakeholder should be able to add business rules on any given asset
type, as one example of using automation logic to further reduce
operating costs.</p>

from investors.</li>
<li>Reference Rate - Some types of assets (such as floating rate notes)
may have attributes linked to external data (such as reference rate),
and such information must be fed into the ledger network.</li>
<li>Asset Timer - Many types of financial assets have predefined life
spans and are required to make periodic payments to their owners, so
a timer is required to automate the operation management of these
assets.</li>
<li>Asset Auditor - Asset transactions must be made auditable to third
parties. For example, regulators may want to audit transactions and
movements of assets to measure market risks.</li>
<li>Obfuscation of account balances - Individual account balances must be
obfuscated so that no one can deduce the exact amount that an
investor owns.</li>
<li>Validation Access – Only nodes with validation rights are allowed to
validate transactions that update the balances of an asset type (this
could be restricted to CSD and/or the issuer).</li>
<li>View access – Only accounts with view access rights are allowed to
interrogate the chaincode that defines an asset type. If an asset
represents shares of publicly traded companies, then the view access
right must be granted to every entity on the network.</li>

<h2>One Trade, One Contract<a class="headerlink" href="#one-trade-one-contract" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>From the time that a trade is captured by the front office until the
trade is finally settled, only one contract that specifies the trade
will be created and used by all participants. The middle office will
enrich the same electronic contract submitted by the front office, and
that same contract will then be used by counter parties to confirm and
affirm the trade. Finally, securities depository will settle the trade
by executing the trading instructions specified on the contract. When
dealing with bulk trades, the original contract can be broken down into
sub-contracts that are always linked to the original parent contract.</p>

<div class="section" id="direct-communication">
<h2>Direct Communication<a class="headerlink" href="#direct-communication" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Company A announces its intention to raise 2 Billion USD by way of
rights issue. Because this is a voluntary action, Company A needs to
ensure that complete details of the offer are sent to shareholders in
real time, regardless of how many intermediaries are involved in the
process (such as receiving/paying agents, CSD, ICSD, local/global
custodian banks, asset management firms, etc). Once a shareholder has
made a decision, that decision will also be processed and settled
(including the new issuance of shares) in real time. If a shareholder
sold its rights to a third party, the securities depository must be able
to record the new shares under the name of their new rightful owner.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="separation-of-asset-ownership-and-custodians-duties">
<h2>Separation of Asset Ownership and Custodian’s Duties<a class="headerlink" href="#separation-of-asset-ownership-and-custodians-duties" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Assets should always be owned by their actual owners, and asset owners
must be able to allow third-party professionals to manage their assets
without having to pass legal ownership of assets to third parties (such
as nominee or street name entities). If issuers need to send messages or
payments to asset owners (for example, listed share holders), issuers
send them directly to asset owners. Third-party asset managers and/or
custodians can always buy, sell, and lend assets on behalf of their
owners. Under this arrangement, asset custodians can focus on providing
value-add services to shareowners, without worrying about asset
ownership duties such as managing and redirecting payments from issuers
to shareowners.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="interoperability-of-assets">
<h2>Interoperability of Assets<a class="headerlink" href="#interoperability-of-assets" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If an organization requires 20,000 units of asset B, but instead owns
10,000 units of asset A, it needs a way to exchange asset A for asset B.
Though the current market might not offer enough liquidity to fulfill
this trade quickly, there might be plenty of liquidity available between
asset A and asset C, and also between asset C and asset B. Instead of
settling for market limits on direct trading (A for B) in this case, a
chain network connects buyers with “buried” sellers, finds the best
match (which could be buried under several layers of assets), and
executes the transaction.</p>
